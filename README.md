# 2-player-game-tic-tac-toe
Description
This is a Tic Tac Toe game, but it has been slightly modified. Instead of a 3x3 grid, it will have a 5x5 grid. This makes the game more challenging and adds more variety. With a 3x3 grid, the game can tend to end in a stalemate because it's a 3x3 grid, and your opponent's plan can be easily predicted within a short time, making the game easy to play and repetitive. So, adding the 5x5 grid can make it more interesting and challenging, simply due to the fact that the grid is larger, and you can also come up with more techniques to win the game and won't be stopped as easily compared to with a 3x3 grid. With another feature, where you are able to remove a mark that is placed by the player, this will allow you to potentially revert a mistake you have made in the game, rather than only being able to play accordingly to where your opponent has placed their mark.
Features
5x5 Grid: A larger grid to allow for more gameplay.
Two-Player Support: A game designed for two players.
Can Remove Marks: With this additional feature, you can remove a 'nought' or 'cross' instead of placing one, adding more depth to the game and allowing for different strategies.
Based on Console: Can be played in any Python environment
Instructions
Run the file in a Python environment.
Input player names (2 players).
You choose where you want to place your mark on the 5x5 grid by entering a coordinate, e.g., '1 0' (a space is required between the numbers). To remove a mark, type 'r', then the system will prompt you to enter a coordinate.
The first player to get all 5 of their marks in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins.
